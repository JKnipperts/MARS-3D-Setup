### Setup for MARS 3D

Another retro programming project of mine.
MARS 3D is a rather unknown asian clone of the first-person shooter video game classic DOOM . 
Some time ago I was asked if I could write a new setup program for this game for a fan project. Of course I gladly accepted and wrote my first DOS program in a long time.

## Features:
- Very fast mode 12h (640x480x16) VGA graphics routines
- mouse control
- Read/write "Miles Sound System" configuration files
- Own keyboard handler
- Starting a network game from the Setup menu
